Tue 10.3:

Overview:
The current version of the program already works pretty well. The most important classes of this project are: Regression, Plot, Data and UI.
The Regression class handles the calculation of the regression model from a data set. Three types of regressions have been implemented:
linear, exponential and logarithmic. More information can be found from the class Regression. The Plot class first maps the data between some
constraints. These mapped values are used to create coordinates for the lines and squares (scalafx) of the plot. The Data class handles 
the reading of the data set The program currently supports txt, csv and xlsx files. The UI class is also implemented. The user can choose 
constraints for the plot. 

Workload:
I have worked around 65h for this project.

Problems:
Importing an empty excel file causes an error.
The user has to click the "ok" button two times when importing csv or xlsx files. 
The user can make the plot look stupid. (long label texts, weird constraints)
The user may only "zoom" certain amount because the axes only work for integers.

I think I am already pretty happy with my program so I did not think about it during the last few weeks. I'll try to focus on the problems in April.

Thu 16.4.

Overview:
Consentrated on finding the issues about the program, but so many hours have been spend during this project that I did not fix most of the problems.
Most of the time was spend testing, writing the report and trying to get the program work on different computers.

Workload:
55h (writing report 40h)


Workload overall:
Around 120h
